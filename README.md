# witas - The Witness tas tools

## Features
- Some functions hooked and output logging to a file.
- Basic automation of the movement keys

## Planned features
- Playing a tas from a script input file
- Playback control: pausing, fast forwarding
- Savestates
- Various utilites to help with tasing
    - Huds
    - routing helpers
    - freecam/noclip?
    - probably will have some feature overlap with the trainer
    - In my wildest dreams, we would also leverage pathfinding and automatic puzzle solving
- Scan instead of adresses
- Windows support

## Todo
- Document the script format
- Extend script format
- Test consistency
- Add mouse movement/running
- Base the tas timer on the global timer instead of the number of calls to get_controller
- Add press/release information to the ControllerState to mimic actual key press

# Contributing
The project is open to contributions. TODO: brief explanation of how it works.
